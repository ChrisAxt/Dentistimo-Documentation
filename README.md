  2. The system should allow patients to book a dentist appointment
  3. The system should allow the patients to cancel their bookings.
  4. The system should use middleware based on MQTT.

  17. The system should send a confirmation/rejection message to the user when they cancel a booking.
  18. The system should display information about the clinics. 

  ## Non-functional requirements

   1. The system should be easy for users to use:
   2. From the main page, patients should be able to book an appointment in less than 5 clicks 
   3. The system should be fault tolerant 
   4. Architectural styles such as Pipe-and-Filter, Publish/subscribe and Client/server are supposed to be combined
   5. The system should not crash

  ## Software architecture
We are planning to use a mix of different architectural styles. The architectural styles we will use are pub/sub, event-driven and client-server. Pub/sub will be used to enable components to publish and/or subscribe to different topics. Basically itâ€™s the way components will communicate with eachother. Event-driven is used with the MQTT being event mediator and components being event processors. Client-server style will be used to create separation between backend and frontend. 

We are planning to base our backend on node.js and use mongoose to connect it to our mongoDB database. The frontend will be based on Vuejs
